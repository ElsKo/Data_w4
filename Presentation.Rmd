## Shiny App

The shiny app makes histograms of the dataset Rocks which is provided by the dataset package. The user can choose one of the four variables (area, peri, perm and shape) of the dataset. This variable will be used for the histogram. Next to that, the user can choose how many breaks will be used for the histogram.

## Rock Dataset
A short preview of the rock dataset:
```{r}
data(rock)
data<-rock
head(rock)
```

The shinyapps website didn't want to show the graphs after I published them. They worked fine in the R-envrionment, but when using the app from the website, it gave en error that the data couldn't be found. Therefore, I manually created a dataframe with the same values as the original Rock dataset.

## UI Script
The shiny app consists of a UI script and a server script. This is the UI script:

```
shinyUI(fluidPage(
    headerPanel("Histograms of the Rock dataset"),
    sidebarPanel(
        radioButtons('variable','Which variable should be used 
        in the histogram', choices = colnames(dataset)),
        sliderInput('breaks', 'How many breaks in the histogram', 5,20,10),
        h5("Documentation"),
        h6("This app makes histograms of the dataset Rocks which is provided 
        by the dataset package. The user can choose one of the four variables
        (area, peri, perm and shape) of the dataset. This variable will....,
    mainPanel(plotOutput('Plot', height = "700px"))))
```

## Server Script
This is the Server script:
```
shinyServer(function(input, output) {
    
    output$Plot <- renderPlot({
        
        x<-dataset[,input$variable]
        hist(x, breaks=input$breaks, 
        main=paste("Histogram of",input$variable))
        
    })
    
})
```
